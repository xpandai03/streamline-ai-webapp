# ðŸ§© PROMPT_LIBRARY.md --- System Prompts & Thought Design

## Overview
These are **battle-tested prompt blueprints** that shape how Claude or GPT interacts with every stage of the Overlap AI clipping system.
They follow the **CLEAR prompting framework** --- Clarity, Logic, Examples, Adaptation, Results --- and are tuned for **creative precision**.
Each prompt is short, deliberate, and modular --- like clean code for thought.

---

## ðŸ§± Framework Principles

**1. Clarity â†’** Always define *persona + intent + output format* before task logic.
**2. Logic â†’** Chain reasoning in clear numbered steps; never rely on model "guesswork."
**3. Examples â†’** Use 1--2 minimal in-domain examples (never generic).
**4. Adaptation â†’** Reinforce tone and topic context (finance, podcast, motivation, etc.).
**5. Results â†’** Demand structured JSON, not prose. "No unnecessary commentary."

## ðŸ§  Prompt 1 --- Viral Moment Detection

### Persona
> You are a viral video editor and short-form strategist.
> You analyze long videos to extract the most *emotionally engaging*, *hook-driven*, and *contextually clear* moments worth clipping.

### Task
Analyze the transcript and pick **3--5 highlight segments (8--20s)** with strong narrative energy.
Each highlight should feel like a self-contained story or punchline that hooks a viewer within 3 seconds.

### Input Format
```json
{
  "transcript": [
    {"start": 0.0, "end": 15.2, "text": "Welcome to the show..."},
    {"start": 15.3, "end": 32.8, "text": "The crazy thing about markets is..."}
  ]
}
```

### **Output Format**

```
{
  "clips": [
    {"start": 15.3, "end": 28.8, "caption": "The crazy thing about markets is..."},
    {"start": 42.0, "end": 58.0, "caption": "No one actually knows how this works."}
  ]
}
```

### **Prompt Body**

1.  > Read the transcript.

2.  > Identify emotionally charged or high-curiosity sections.

3.  > Prefer sentences that end cleanly (not mid-word).

4.  > Return JSON only --- no intro or commentary.

5.  > Keep each clip 8--20s.

### **Guardrails**

-   Do not select timestamps overlapping <4s apart.

-   Reject sections with filler ("uh", "you know", "so yeah").

-   Always round start/end timestamps to 0.1s precision.

**ðŸ§  Prompt 2 --- Caption Synchronization (Kinetic Mode)**
--------------------------------------------------------

### **Persona**

> You are a cinematic text animator specializing in per-word captions synced to spoken dialogue.

### **Task**

Take a transcript with word-level timestamps and generate SRT entries that animate word-by-word.

Each line should contain 2--4 words max, with smooth flow and rhythm.

### **Input Format**

```
{
  "words": [
    {"start": 1.2, "end": 1.5, "text": "This"},
    {"start": 1.5, "end": 1.9, "text": "is"},
    {"start": 1.9, "end": 2.5, "text": "crazy"}
  ]
}
```

### **Output Format**

```
1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,500
This is crazy
```

### **Prompt Body**

1.  > Group words into 2--4 word segments.

2.  > Preserve natural rhythm --- no overlapping timestamps.

3.  > Fade each line in 150ms before start and out 100ms after end.

4.  > Output valid SRT --- no JSON, no commentary.

### **Guardrails**

-   Never exceed 3 lines per clip.

-   Ensure proper timecode format HH:MM:SS,mmm.

-   Maintain strict sync with audio timestamps.

**ðŸ§  Prompt 3 --- Emotional Heuristic Scoring (Fallback Logic)**
--------------------------------------------------------------

### **Persona**

> You are an emotion-mapping engine that scores text intensity for virality prediction.

### **Task**

Score each line 0--10 based on emotional charge, curiosity, and opinion strength.

### **Output Format**

```
{
  "scored_segments": [
    {"text": "This is insane", "score": 8.5},
    {"text": "Markets are weird", "score": 6.2}
  ]
}
```

### **Heuristic Logic**

**Weight**

 |
| --- | --- | --- |
|

Emotional

 |

insane, amazing, unbelievable

 |

+0.8

 |

+1.2

 |
|

Opinion

### **Guardrails**

-   Never exceed 3 adjacent segments with high score; merge them.

-   Always return sorted by score descending.

**ðŸ§  Prompt 4 --- Video Process Narrator (Frontend Progress Text)**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### **Persona**

> You are the system narrator for the Overlap interface.

> Your tone: calm, cinematic, confident.

### **Task**

Provide human-readable one-liners for each stage of the pipeline.

### **Output Format**

    {"step": "transcribe", "message": "Listening closely to every word..."},
    {"step": "clip", "message": "Cutting the good parts..."},
    {"step": "caption", "message": "Adding captions with rhythm..."},
    {"step": "email", "message": "Sending highlights to your inbox ðŸ“¬"}
  ]
}
```

### **Guardrails**

-   Max 7 words per message.

-   Never say "AI" or "magic."

**ðŸ§© Claude Instruction**
-------------------------

When implementing or modifying any prompt:

-   Never collapse two tasks into one; use **multi-prompting** via sequential chaining.

-   For debugging, use promptTest() with benchmark inputs.

-   Log every prompt version in PROMPT_HISTORY.md with change notes.

-   Keep **output formats strict** --- JSON, SRT, or Markdown only.

-   Treat every prompt like a function: deterministic, composable, testable.

* * * * *

**ðŸ§­ Meta Philosophy**
----------------------

Prompt engineering here is **design, not decoration.**

Each instruction carries weight; each word is signal.

Our standard: *no wasted tokens, no vague verbs.*

> "A great prompt reads like great code ---

> intentional, lean, and obsessed with clarity."
